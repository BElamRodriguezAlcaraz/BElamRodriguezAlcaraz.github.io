        This paper constructs the first Beveridge Curves for Mexico and its regions using a newly compiled dataset on formal sector job vacancies.
        Incorporating this novel vacancy dataset helps us define structural macroeconomic shocks and explore business cycle movements both at the
        national and sectoral level. Focusing on the post-COVID-19 period, we document a sharp increase in labor market slack at the onset of the
        pandemic, followed by a gradual tightening beginning in 2021, with a more rapid recovery in northern regions. By 2023, vacancy rates
        declined without a corresponding rise in unemployment, suggesting a rebalancing of labor demand. We further introduce a new measure of
        labor market slack based on the vacancies-to-unemployment (V/U) ratio for Mexico, which is used to explore national and regional Phillips
        Curves. Finally, we estimate a Structural Bayesian VAR model. We show that the dynamics of the Beveridge Curve are primarily shaped by
        labor-market shocks rather than goods-market shocks. Specifically, unemployment dynamics are mainly driven by labor supply and matching
        efficiency shocks, while wage-bargaining shocks account for most of the variation in vacancies at the national level, with heterogeneity
        across regions.

        This paper analyzes skill mismatches in the Mexican labor market using a Skill Mismatch Index (SMI) to quantify imbalances
        between labor supply and demand. Results reveal a shortage of workers with primary education and an oversupply of highly educated workers,
        particularly in government, entertainment, and retail trade. Regional disparities persist, with the south experiencing the highest mismatch.
        Limited worker mobility exacerbates these imbalances, which tend to intensify as the economy grows. Addressing mismatches requires targeted
        training, labor mobility incentives, and education reforms to improve workforce alignment and enhance labor market efficiency.

        How are expropriations related to governments&#39; debt defaults? The literature has shown that expropriation episodes and debt defaults have
        rarely coincided, suggesting that each event resulted from a different set of factors. The aim of this article is twofold. First, I analyze
        default-expropriation relationships in the years previous to the debt crisis of 1982. I show that while default and expropriation episodes
        did not always coincide, countries that expropriated at least once during the period were also those that defaulted more often. I observe that
        countries that expropriated had worse macroeconomic indicators than countries that did not. Second, I focus on the case of Mexico, when its
        announcement of a debt moratorium in August 1982 was followed, less than one month later, by the nationalization of its banking system. Both
        events were outcomes of an acute economic crisis. The nationalization announcement aggravated the crisis, because an agreement with the IMF
        seemed increasingly uncertain. I provide evidence from the largely overlooked bond market (on which the government never defaulted) that shows
        that investors reacted negatively to the bank nationalization. Finally, I present original, published, and unpublished primary sources to
        demonstrate that commercial banks, as well as international organizations, expressed misgivings about the banks&#39; nationalization. This fact
        may have hindered the country&#39;s economic recovery through the deterioration of public confidence and a decline in foreign investment.

        We use the largest modern US deportation program to investigate the effect of deportation shocks on establishments in the communities of
        origin of migrants. We link these deportations to Mexican municipalities by using transnational data on the undocumented migrant network
        and then merge them with rich establishment panel data, which includes formal and informal firms. Mexican regions experiencing larger
        deportation shocks observe an increase in their establishments’ size, revenue, and exports. We provide suggestive evidence that these changes
        are driven by increases in consumer demand, the transference of human and financial capital, and reductions in labor costs.

        I investigate the impact of the arrival of individuals born in developed countries (North-to-South migration) on natives&#39; wages. Using
        Mexican Population Census data, I first characterize migration to Mexico and show that many foreign-born individuals from developed countries
        work, contrary to stereotypes. Then, I use an instrumental-variables approach relying on enclaves and find that increasing the number of
        foreign-born individuals from developed countries decreases natives&#39; wages. I provide evidence suggesting that this is driven by the creation
        of low-paying jobs in industries relying on local consumption, and the substitution of natives for some white-collar jobs.
